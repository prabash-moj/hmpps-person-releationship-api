    "description": "<div>\n  <h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n  <p>This service provides a number of endpoints for searching and reading prisoners that have been registered with the\n    HMPPS prison service. This may be current or previous prisoners or other people that might be in secure\n    hospitals.</p>\n  <h2 id=\"data-provided\">Data provided</h2>\n  <p>The vast majority of the data is sourced from the NOMIS system though in the future this is likely to change as\n    more HMPPS prison data is held outside NOMIS.</p>\n  <p>The data for a person is stored in Elastic Search and is updated after a record in NOMIS is changed. This is\n    typically about a minute after the data is changed in NOMIS. In the unlikely circumstance that your service needs\n    data that is 100% up to date with NOMIS then the\n    <a href=\"https://prison-api-dev.prison.service.justice.gov.uk/swagger-ui/index.html\">prison-api</a>\n    might be a better service to use.\n    One use case this might be appropriate for is if you need up-to-date data at the point a NOMIS prisoner event\n    is received; this service also updates its records as a result of NOMIS prisoner events, so you might encounter a\n    race\n    condition if your read is triggered from the same event.\n  </p>\n  <div>The data returned for each prisoner record is essentially a snapshot of key prisoner data. This includes the\n    following:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Identifiers from both NOMIS and those held in other systems</li>\n      <li>Personal details such as name and date of birth (including aliases)</li>\n      <li>Current prison status such as the current location (including cell)</li>\n      <li>Latest sentence details</li>\n      <li>Alerts</li>\n    </ul>\n    See the schema definition for the API for full details.\n  </div>\n  <h2 id=\"role-restrictions\">Role restrictions</h2>\n  <p>\n    Role restrictions in this service are applied by a `@PreAuthorize` annotation at either resource or service level.\n    Furthermore the annotation can be applied at individual method level or class level.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Each endpoint in this API documentation should normally include what restrictions are applied. If there is any doubt\n    then it is worth looking at the github repository at\n    https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-prisoner-search/ and looking at the endpoint in question.\n  </p>\n\n  The following roles are currently in use in this service:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH. This role grants access to all of the search endpoints.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      ROLE_PRISONER_IN_PRISON_SEARCH. This role is limited to protect the \"/prison/{prisonId}/prisoners\" endpoint for\n      clients that only need access to this endpoint in prisoner offender search. For more general access the\n      ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH would be more suitable.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      ROLE_VIEW_PRISONER_DATA. This role is only needed at present for the \"/prisoner/{id}\" endpoint to retrieve\n      detailed information about a particular prisoner, as opposed to the rest of the search endpoints in this service\n      that can return multiple matches.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      ROLE_GLOBAL_SEARCH. This role is deprecated and replaced by the ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH. All of the endpoints in\n      this service that accept this role also accept ROLE_PRISONER_SEARCH so the latter should be used in preference.\n      It was originally created for Prison API and is still in use there.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      ROLE_EVENTS_ADMIN. This role is only needed for the \"/events/prisoner/received/{prisonerNumber}\" endpoint\n      and is only required in the event that a prisoner event wasn't raised by the service when their data in the\n      service\n      had changed.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <h2 id=\"types-of-endpoints\">Types of endpoints</h2>\n  <h3>Searching for a specific prisoner based on criteria</h3>\n  <p>\n    These are endpoints that use the core Elastic Search features to locate a prisoner record based on a set of\n    criteria;\n    for instance name, date of birth or unique identifier (such as the Police National Computer PNC number).\n    Typically, they return many results and a summary of those results would be presented to an end user.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Matching records</h3>\n  <p>\n    Similar to searching but typically using a criteria from a different system; for instance, key data from a probation\n    record or court record.\n    These will use an algorithm that matches based on data that is likely to be most reliable for matching; for\n    instance,\n    PNC number or name with date of birth.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Retrieving a specific record</h3>\n  <p>\n    Retrieving a specific record typically by a unique identifier; for instance, prisoner number (aka NOMS number). This\n    is a convenient way of viewing a summary of a prisoner record and is typically quicker than using the equivalent API\n    in <b>prison-api</b>.\n  </p>\n  <h3>Retrieving batches of records</h3>\n  <p>\n    Retrieving a batch of records either by supplying a list of identifiers or a criteria that will a match many\n    records;\n    for instance, all people in a prison wing or people to be released on a specific date.\n  </p>\n</div>\n",
