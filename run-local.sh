# This script is used to run the Book a video link API locally.
#
# It runs with a combination of properties from the default spring profile (in application.yaml) and supplemented
# with the -local profile (from application-local.yml). The latter overrides some of the defaults.
#
# The environment variables here will also override values supplied in spring profile properties, specifically
# around setting the DB properties, SERVER_PORT and client credentials to match those used in the docker-compose files.
